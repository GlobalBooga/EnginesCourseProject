#### Group Formation

I am working alone. However, that decision came after finding out that there wasn't a partner for me. My strategy is simple. First, I think about what project would benefit me the most. Since my GDW game is being made in Unreal Engine, I figured that working in Unreal Engine would serve me as good practice. With this constraint in mind, I talked to some people that I'd want to work with and probed them about their plans. It turned out people were either already in groups or were trying to avoid Unreal Engine. Therefore, I will be working alone. This is fine because it allows me to keep my scope small.

#### Interactive Media Scenario Information

The interactive media scenario presented in this project is a snapshot of my GDW game. It is essentially a demo of the AI used by all NPCs in the game. The scenario shown off in the project is a live run of this AI working. The purpose is to pressure test it in different situations to make sure it doesn't break and works as intended. In this demo, the user's role is to watch and judge. It is intended to be "played" from the editor, where the user will place or move objects in the scene and watch how the AI responds or acts during play. However, the player can also move around and spawn things.


#### About the Project

As stated above, this project is a snapshot the AI system in my GDW game. It's a technical demo, not a game. 
This system is for all of the AI in an atmospheric, realtime strategy, tower defense game where you run and defend your town from nightly invasions by commanding your villagers. The AI solution implemented in this project is a hierarchical task network. Characters will be given a list of complex tasks based on their occupation, sorted by priority. They automatically perform tasks based on their world state - which is directly controlled by sensors.
